# Polymath CLI Glossary

We like to have clarity on the objects we are explaining and talking about.

We have the core [Polymath GLOSSARY](https://github.com/dglazkov/polymath/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md), and this is one scoped for the CLI:

- `Action`: the things you can tell the CLI to do (e.g. `ask`, `complete`, `info`, `import`)
- `Options`: options supplied to the CLI globally (e.g. `-c <config>`, `-h`)
- `Args`: arguments supplied to Polymath invocations and for other things we invoke from CLI in the future
- `Config`: configuration JSON loaded via the JSON file/Firebase config/env etc. Looks like [host.SAMPLE.json](https://github.com/dglazkov/polymath/blob/main/host.SAMPLE.json) or [these](https://github.com/polymath-ai/polymath-remix/tree/main/app/config)
